            About Us
        </h1>
        
        <br>
        
        <p class="p_style">Welcome to Bean and Brew - Brewing joy one cup at a time.</p>
        
        <p class="p_style">At Bean and Brew, coffee isn't just a drink — it's a ritual, a comfort, and a daily moment of connection. Founded on a love for rich flavors and authentic community, we're more than just your neighborhood coffee shop — we're your second home.</p>

        <br>

        <h2 class="h1_style">Our Story</h2>

        <p class="p_style" >Bean and Brew was born from a simple idea: create a space where people can slow down, sip something special, and feel at home. 
            Whether you're grabbing your morning pick-me-up, catching up with friends, or diving into your latest creative project, our space is designed for you. 
            We partner with local roasters to source high-quality, ethically grown beans — always roasted to perfection. 
            Our baristas are trained not just to make great coffee, but to craft meaningful moments — whether it's your go-to order or something entirely new.</p>

        <br>

        <h2 class="h1_style">More Than Coffee</h2>

        <p class="p_style">While coffee is at our core, we offer more than just your daily brew. 
            From carefully curated teas to seasonal specialties and fresh pastries baked every morning, everything on our menu is made with care. 
            We believe it's the little details — the perfect froth, the flaky crust, the friendly hello — that make the biggest difference.</p>

        <br>

        <h2 class="h1_style">Our Vibe</h2>

        <p class="p_style">Bean and Brew blends modern comfort with cozy charm. 
            Whether you stay for five minutes or a few hours, you'll always be greeted with a smile, 
            the aroma of fresh coffee, and a welcoming atmosphere where everyone feels at ease.</p>

        <br>

        <h2 class="h1_style">Sustainability and Our Community</h2>

        <p class="p_style">We believe in being a good neighbor — not only to the people we serve, but to the planet we share. 
            That's why we use compostable cups and lids, recycle wherever possible, and encourage reusable mugs with a discount for every refill. 
            Our commitment to sustainability is part of everything we do, from working with eco-conscious suppliers to minimizing waste in our daily operations.</p>

        <br>

        <h2 class="h1_style">Join the Brew Crew</h2>

        <p class="p_style">We're proud to be part of this vibrant community — supporting local artists, 
            hosting may different events, and creating a space where connection thrives. 
            Whether you're a regular or it's your first visit, we want you to feel like you belong..</p>

        <br>

        <p class="p_style">So come by, pull up a chair, and stay awhile. At Bean and Brew, there's always a fresh cuppa - and a warm welcome - waiting for you.</p>
